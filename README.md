# Andrew's Logseq Graph

My Logseq Knowledge space for creating notes about software development, planning my day, and 
a place for freewriting, idea threading, and much much more. I intend on deploying this with 
my new digital garden at some point in the future or figuring out how to integrate them in
some manner. 

## To Do

- [ ] Figure out how to create a public template for Logseq
- [ ] Figure out how it would be rendered
- [ ] Figure out what metadata to use
- [ ] Figure out a SSG or something
