- # 6 Sorting
	- How to sort a set of records into order, where each record consists of a key (alphabetical, numerical, or several fields) and data. The algorithm's output should include the exact same set of records, but shuffled so that the keys are in order. Usually keys are in ascending order, but descending order requires only a minor change in sorting algorithms
	- ## The Sorting Problem
		- A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that given a list of records containing a key and some data, reorders the list so that the keys are in non-decreasing order (no key is smaller than its preceding key) and the output list is a permutation of the input list, retaining all original records.
