- # [Glitch Guide to the Fediverse](https://blog.glitch.com/post/glitch-communitys-guide-to-building-the-fediverse/)
	- Interest in the fediverse has never been greater, and we‚Äôre so excited 
	  for the opportunity to support a decentralized, creative community 
	  building the web together. If you‚Äôre new to the fediverse, or federated 
	  social networks, there are several fantastic explainers available but 
	  here are a few of our favorites to help you get started.
		- [Mastodon‚Äôs docs site](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/): Learn how the fediverse works, how to sign up for a server, and how to use the API to customize your experience.
		- [Fedi.Garden](https://fedi.garden/): A curated site 
		  featuring servers on Mastodon and across the fediverse that are open to 
		  the public and practice responsible moderation
		- [Fedi.Tips](https://fedi.tips/): The ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù guide 
		  to Mastodon and the fediverse that answers your questions from getting 
		  started to accessibility, to running your own instance and more!
		  The fediverse is one of the latest examples of the way moving toward a 
		  more open web experience benefits us all! We‚Äôre excited to share that [Fast Forward](https://www.fastly.com/blog/fast-forward-lets-build-the-good-internet-together)‚ÄîFastly‚Äôs program supporting open source initiatives and communities‚Äîhas recently added Mastodon as one of [their latest program members](https://thenewstack.io/anil-dash-on-mastodon-joining-fastlys-open-source-program/).
		  Mastodon is one of the most popular decentralized social networking 
		  platforms, but by far not the only one. In fact, there are multiple 
		  standardized, open protocols that implement federation, such as Activity
		  Pub, the one used by Mastodon.
