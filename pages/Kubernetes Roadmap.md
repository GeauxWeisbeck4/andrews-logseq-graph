- # Kubernetes Roadmap
	- ## Introduction
		- Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform 
		  that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized 
		  applications. It provides a way to abstract the underlying 
		  infrastructure and manage applications at scale, while also offering 
		  flexibility, portability, and a rich feature set. Kubernetes has become 
		  the de facto standard for container orchestration due to its widespread 
		  adoption, active community, and ability to handle complex, multi-tiered 
		  applications.
