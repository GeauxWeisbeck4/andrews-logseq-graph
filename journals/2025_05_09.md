# Friday - March 9th, 2025 | Sprint 21
	- Well, I am getting started a little late here because I got really into that book, Red Notice. It is quite the book I have to say and will finish reading it ehh... probably tonight or tomorrow. I need to get to work right now however, so that is what I am doing. I think I am going to start off WeisMind with a piece on public lands, but I am not quite sure yet. Let's get down to business though.
