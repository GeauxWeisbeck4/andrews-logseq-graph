# Monday - May 12th, 2025 | Sprint 21
	- It is a glum, rainy day out there and I hope that we can get some money coming in early today because I got things to do. Lots to do today. Gonna go through Beej's C Guide this morning a bit, maybe some FreeCodeCamp.org learning and a couple other things. Really need to plan out the week though first on Trello.
