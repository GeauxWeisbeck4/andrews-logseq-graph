- # 3 Abstract Data Types
	- Abstract data types (ADT) are defined by the operations it supports and the behavior it provides. It specifies needs and requirements in general
	- This book looks at data structures in the context of an ADT
	- ## Data Types
		- Data types are those defined by sets of possible values it may represent and the operations that can be performed on it -> example: possible to concatenate two strings, perform logical operations with booleans, do arithmetic with integer numbers, or compare floating point numbers
		- Basic idea of an ADT is specifying the operations that can be done, not internal aspects
	- ## Abstraction
		- Abstraction implies hiding or omitting details and reaching instead for an overarching higher-level idea -> Ignore implementation aspects so we can concentrate on our needs
		- ### Encapsulation
			- Designing modules as if they had a "shell" or a "capsule" around them so only the module is responsible for handling its data. Makes design more coherent and cohesive
		- ### Data Hiding
			- Hide inner details of a module's implementation from rest of systems so they can ensured to be changed without affecting any other parts of the code. No one can access inner details from the outside
		- ### Modularity
			- Dividing a system into spearate modules that can be designed and developed independently from the rest of the system.
	- ## Operations and Mutations
		- Mutable vs immutable values are a common way to classify data types
		- In JS, objects and arrays are mutable, you can edit them w/out creating new ones. Numbers and strings are immutable -> a new, different and distinct value is created when you apply an operation to them
