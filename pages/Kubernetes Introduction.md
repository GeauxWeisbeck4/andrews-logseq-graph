- ## Introduction
	- Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform 
	  that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized 
	  applications. It provides a way to abstract the underlying 
	  infrastructure and manage applications at scale, while also offering 
	  flexibility, portability, and a rich feature set. Kubernetes has become 
	  the de facto standard for container orchestration due to its widespread 
	  adoption, active community, and ability to handle complex, multi-tiered 
	  applications.
- ## Kubernetes overview
	- Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for 
	  managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both 
	  declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly 
	  growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely 
	  available.
	- The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot.
	  K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between 
	  the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014.
	  Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running 
	  production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices 
	  from the community.
- ## Why Kubernetes
	- Kubernetes (k8s) is needed because it provides a powerful and 
	  flexible platform for deploying and managing containerized applications 
	  at scale. It allows for easy scalability, high resilience, application 
	  portability, automation of many tasks, and standardization of the 
	  container platform. k8s also helps reduce complexity and workload for 
	  operations teams, enabling them to focus on more strategic initiatives.
