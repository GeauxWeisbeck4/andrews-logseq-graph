- # Chapter 2: Objects and Classes
	- Objects are useful without classes, but classes make them easier to understand.
	- A well-designed class defines a contract that code using its instances can rely on.
	- Objects that respect the same contract are 
	  polymorphic, i.e., they can be used interchangeably even if they do 
	  different specific things.
	- Objects and classes can be thought of as dictionaries with stereotyped behavior.
	- Most languages allow functions and methods to take a variable number of arguments.
	- Inheritance can be implemented in several ways that differ in the order in which objects and classes are searched for methods.
	- ## Object Oriented Programming
		- Answers these two questions:
			- What is a natural way to represent real-world “things” in code?
			- How can we organize code to make it easier to understand, test, and extend?
