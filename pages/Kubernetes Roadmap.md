- # Kubernetes Roadmap
	- ## Introduction
		- Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform 
		  that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized 
		  applications. It provides a way to abstract the underlying 
		  infrastructure and manage applications at scale, while also offering 
		  flexibility, portability, and a rich feature set. Kubernetes has become 
		  the de facto standard for container orchestration due to its widespread 
		  adoption, active community, and ability to handle complex, multi-tiered 
		  applications.
	- ## Kubernetes overview
		- Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for 
		  managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both 
		  declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly 
		  growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely 
		  available.
		- The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot.
		  K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between 
		  the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014.
		  Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running 
		  production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices 
		  from the community.
