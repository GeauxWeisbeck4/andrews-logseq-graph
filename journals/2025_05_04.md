Need to create some content, make some picks with my bonus bet, and hell, maybe we'll even make a little money while we're at it good gosh gee willikers! Oh boy, what a wonderful Sunday to be alive. There's a whole lot we have in store for ya today, so don't go anywhere, alright? Or I may just have to show up on your front step with some Mormons if ya know what I mean!
