- # Functional Programming in JavaScript
	- ## Why use FP?
		- ### Understandable
			- Produces shorter and cleaner code
		- ### Maintainable
			- Makes it easier to understand and maintain
		- ### Testable
			- Unit testing allows you to verify the behavior of each component of your code and provides a sort of documentation, providing examples of how to use any given function
		- ### Modular
			- Focuses on separation of concerns by writing code's features independent of each other and are highly cohesive and loosly copuled
		- ### Reusable
			- Reusing code saves time and money
	- ## JavaScript as a Functional Language
		- It actually is great for fp yo
		- ### Functions as First Class Objects
