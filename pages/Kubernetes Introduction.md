- ## Introduction
	- Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform 
	  that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized 
	  applications. It provides a way to abstract the underlying 
	  infrastructure and manage applications at scale, while also offering 
	  flexibility, portability, and a rich feature set. Kubernetes has become 
	  the de facto standard for container orchestration due to its widespread 
	  adoption, active community, and ability to handle complex, multi-tiered 
	  applications.
- ## Kubernetes overview
	- Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for 
	  managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both 
	  declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly 
	  growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely 
	  available.
	- The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot.
	  K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between 
	  the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014.
	  Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running 
	  production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices 
	  from the community.
- ## Why Kubernetes
	- Kubernetes (k8s) is needed because it provides a powerful and 
	  flexible platform for deploying and managing containerized applications 
	  at scale. It allows for easy scalability, high resilience, application 
	  portability, automation of many tasks, and standardization of the 
	  container platform. k8s also helps reduce complexity and workload for 
	  operations teams, enabling them to focus on more strategic initiatives.
- ## Key Concepts Terminologies
	- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that 
	  automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized 
	  applications. Here are some important concepts and terminologies in 
	  Kubernetes:
	- Cluster Architecture: The architectural concepts behind Kubernetes.
	- Containers: Technology for packaging an application along with its runtime dependencies.
	- Workloads: Understand Pods, the smallest deployable compute object 
	  in Kubernetes, and the higher-level abstractions that help you to run 
	  them.
	- Services, Load Balancing, and Networking: Concepts and resources behind networking in Kubernetes.
	- Storage: Ways to provide both long-term and temporary storage to Pods in your cluster.
	- Configuration: Resources that Kubernetes provides for configuring Pods.
	- Cluster Administration: Lower-level detail relevant to creating or administering a Kubernetes cluster.
- # Kubernetes Alternatives
	- Kubernetes is a popular open-source container orchestration tool that
	  is widely used for managing and deploying containerized applications. 
	  While there are other container orchestration tools available, such as 
	  Docker Swarm, Mesos, and Nomad, there are some key differences between 
	  Kubernetes and these other tools and some of them are mentioned below:
	- Architecture: Kubernetes is designed as a modular system with many 
	  components that work together to provide container orchestration, such 
	  as the Kubernetes API server, kubelet, kube-proxy, and etcd.
	- Scalability: Kubernetes is designed to handle large-scale deployments and can scale applications up or down based on demand.
	- Flexibility: Kubernetes is highly configurable and can be customized
	  to meet specific requirements, whereas other container orchestration 
	  tools may have more limited configuration options.
	- Portability: Kubernetes is designed to be cloud-agnostic and can run
	  on any public or private cloud platform, as well as on-premises.
	- Community: Kubernetes has a large and active community of developers
	  and users who contribute to its development and provide support.
