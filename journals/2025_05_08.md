# Thursday - May 8th, 2025 | Sprint 21
	- Today is going to be a great day with me getting a lot of shit done. I've taken way to long to get back on track and today is going to be the day where that happens. I'm sick of all this stupid bull shit where I can't even afford to get anything every single day and it is time for that to change with focused learning, lots of practice, and doing the things I need to do. No more Mr. Nice Guy. Getting that digital garden done. Going to find some things that pay me. Going to write. Going to do it all mah fuckers.
