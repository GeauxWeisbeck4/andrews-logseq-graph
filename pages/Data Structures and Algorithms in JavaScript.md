- # Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript
	- ## Introduction
- # Part 1: The Basics
	- In this first part of the book, weâ€™ll start by looking at important 
	  JavaScript features used throughout the book, and then go on to explore 
	  functional programming (FP) for design insights, abstract data types 
	  (ADTs) as they relate to data structures, and the concept of algorithm 
	  performance, which plays a crucial role when designing for efficiency.
