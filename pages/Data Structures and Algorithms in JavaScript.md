- # Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript
	- ## Introduction
- # Part 1: The Basics
	- In this first part of the book, we’ll start by looking at important 
	  JavaScript features used throughout the book, and then go on to explore 
	  functional programming (FP) for design insights, abstract data types 
	  (ADTs) as they relate to data structures, and the concept of algorithm 
	  performance, which plays a crucial role when designing for efficiency.

	- ## [[2 Functional Programming in JavaScript]]
	- ## [[3 Abstract Data Types]]
	- ## [[4 Analyzing Algorithms]]
- # Part Two: Algorithms
	- In this second part of the book, we’ll shift our discussion away from 
	  the theoretical topics of functional programming, abstract data types, 
	  and analysis of algorithms and focus on how to design algorithms, 
	  considering several strategies for discovering solutions to specific 
	  problems.
