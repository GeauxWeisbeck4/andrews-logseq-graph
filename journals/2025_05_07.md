# Wednesday - May 7th, 2025 | Sprint 21
	- Getting started way late today, but that is ok. I'm feeling a lot more awake and ready to roll. Not going to have a lot of time to work in Panera, but I will get a bit done and then focus more on cleaning the tent tonight. Feel like we've been dealing with a lot in the realm of life and that can take a lot of energy and attention away from this work that is also important.
