# Saturday - May 3rd, 2025 | Sprint 20
	- Up nice and early to go to the clinic. I need to get a lot done today because yesterday I was on a good track, but got sidetracked to take care of the kitties. I think we'll be able to leave them more on their own today. I would like to focus on building Fediverse apps and starting to plan out my idea that I came up with yesterday - oh yeah, if I didn't share it on here yet, here's the idea: a decentralized, fediverse social media application that revolves around building a knowledge management workspace where users can build a "digital garden" of sorts and use their social network graph to find similar users, collaborators, employers, etc. It still sounds like a good idea to me today, so I will move onward with it! At least into the initial planning and data collecting phase of things. Anyways, I am going to go ahead and get started with my day and need to get on the bus.
