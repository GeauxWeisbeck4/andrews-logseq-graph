# Monday - May 5th, 2025 | Sprint 21
	- Today is starting out early and not feeling super well, but I just got to the clinic finally and feel better. I'm about to write a complaint about Trish. Frankly I'm tired of the harassment and I should not be subjugated to it when I am going to the bathroom with an upset stomach. But anyways, I've gotten a good start to sprint 21 so far in terms of getting setup with some better productivity tools. I got to plan out my day then I'll be back.
