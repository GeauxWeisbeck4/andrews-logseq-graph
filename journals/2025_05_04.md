	- Good morning VietDurham! We just survived a torrential downfall of thunderstorm and rain last night and it feels good to be alive! Anyways, there's lots to do today! Need to create some content, make some picks with my bonus bet, and hell, maybe we'll even make a little money while we're at it good gosh gee willikers! Oh boy, what a wonderful Sunday to be alive. There's a whole lot we have in store for ya today, so don't go anywhere, alright? Or I may just have to show up on your front step with some
